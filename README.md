## Laravel Skeleton

Laravel Skeleton provides a barebones version of Laravel with some added features for extra customizability.

[Artisan commands](#artisan-commands)  
[Creating a custom Authentication Guard](#creating-a-custom-authentication-guard)  
[Using a StyleMap](#using-a-stylemap)  

##### Artisan commands
```shell
php artisan make:guard
php artisan make:helper
php artisan make:trait
```

##### Creating a custom Authentication Guard
1. Create the guard class
```shell
php artisan make:guard ExampleGuard
```
You may use the `--example` option to specify that the created guard class should contain some example functionality
```shell
php artisan make:guard ExampleGuard --example
```

2. Add an entry into the `guards` property within `config/auth.php`
```php
'guards' => [
    // ...
    'custom' => [
        'driver' => 'example',
        'provider' => 'users'
    ]
]
```
3. Add an entry into the `$guards` property of `App\Providers\AuthServiceProvider`
```php
protected $guards = [
    'example' => 'App\Guards\ExampleGuard',
];
```
4. Create a route using the new authentication guard
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Response;

Route::middleware('auth:custom')->get('/user', function () {
    return Response::json(Auth::user());
});
```

##### Using a StyleMap

The StyleMap helper class can be useful in generating styles based on user settings

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use App\Helpers\StyleMap;

Route::middleware('auth:api')->get('/user', function () {
    return view('index', [
        'vueRootStyle' => StyleMap::create([
            'background-color' => Auth::user()->custom_background_color,
            'color' => Auth::user()->custom_text_color
        ])
    ]);
});
```
